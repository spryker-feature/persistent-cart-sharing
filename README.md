# Spryker Feature: Persistent Cart Sharing

With the Persistent Cart Sharing feature, you can quickly and easily share cart through any communication channel like WhatsApp, Slack, or any other messenger, email, or social network. You can share the cart via a link in two different modes: "internal" and "external".  For Internal users, you can share with "Read Only" or "Full Access" permissions, and for External - in the Preview mode. In the first case, you provide users with the necessary level of access rights to the Cart. In the Preview mode, even users who have no access to the shop can view the cart - but cannot perform any actions. Cart in preview mode can also be shared with users in your company because it's not limited in usage to external users only.
